    "In this first exercise you will train a *small* autoregressive GPT model for character generation (the one used by Karpathy in his video) to generate text in the style of Dante Aligheri. Use [this file](https://archive.org/stream/ladivinacommedia00997gut/1ddcd09.txt), which contains the entire text of Dante's Inferno (**note**: you will have to delete some introductory text at the top of the file before training). Train the model for a few epochs, monitor the loss, and generate some text at the end of training. Qualitatively evaluate the results "

Find an interesting retrieval problem and train a model (starting from a pre-trained LLM of course) to solve it.\n",
